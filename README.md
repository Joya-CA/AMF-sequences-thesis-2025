# AMF-sequences-thesis-2025
Sequences of a local AMF community from three locations in the Okanagan, British Columbia

## Project Objective
This project investigates whether the introduction of intraspecific variation in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) affects a local AMF community. 
Soil samples were collected from vineyard sites in the Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. Soils were pooled and used as growing media in mesocosms containing a mixed plant community.
After a 17 week growing period, samples were taken from each mesocosms and sequenced using a semi-nested appraoch with AMF specific primers.
